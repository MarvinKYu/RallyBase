# Current bugs

## Tournaments and events should automatically start at their set startTime
- Cron-based time-triggered auto-start requires Vercel Pro for sub-daily scheduling. Deferred until plan upgrade.

# Fixed

## Version 0.7.1

### `advanceEventStatus` integration tests failing after v0.6.2
- The v0.6.2 tournament status cascade (DRAFT→PUBLISHED moves events to REGISTRATION_OPEN; PUBLISHED→IN_PROGRESS moves events to IN_PROGRESS) was silently advancing the shared test event before the `advanceEventStatus` describe block ran, leaving it at IN_PROGRESS instead of DRAFT.
- Fixed by adding a `beforeAll` reset inside the `advanceEventStatus` describe block to restore the event to DRAFT, properly isolating that test group from the tournament cascade side-effects.

## Version 0.6.3

### Brackets/RR schedules should be generated automatically upon event start
- When an event transitions to IN_PROGRESS, its bracket (SE) or round-robin schedule is now auto-generated if none exists and there are enough entrants. Implemented as part of `advanceEventStatus` — no cron needed for this trigger.

## Version 0.6.2

### Matches from tournament in draft status showing up in player dashboard
- Player dashboard upcoming matches now filter to only show matches from non-DRAFT tournaments.

### Auto-open registration
- Publishing a tournament now automatically moves all DRAFT events to REGISTRATION_OPEN. New events created after a tournament is published also default to REGISTRATION_OPEN.

### Auto-close registration
- Starting a tournament now automatically moves all REGISTRATION_OPEN events to IN_PROGRESS.

## Version 0.6.1

### No way to navigate directly to event detail page from TD dashboard
- Event names on the TD manage page are now clickable links to the event detail page.

### Edit event button should also show up in the event detail page for TD
- Added an "Edit event" link on the event detail page, visible only to the owning TD.

### Back-route navigation fix
- Edit tournament page back button now returns to the manage page instead of the tournament detail page.
- Event detail back link is now context-aware: TDs return to the manage page, others return to the tournament detail page.

### Add event button should only be in the TD dashboard, no longer in the tournament detail page
- "Add event" button removed from the tournament detail page; now lives exclusively on the TD manage page.

## Version 0.4.1

### Bracket page showing up in round robin format after event creation
After creating a new round robin event with 3 players (call them A, B, C for simplicity) and clicking "generate schedule", app generates a bracket with quarterfinal between player B and C, semifinal between player A and B, and final between player A and C, and shows it on webpage. this should not exist at all, after generating schedule for round robin TD should see the page that can be navigated to by "view standings" button that shows current standings with table of players, w/l, games, points and the match schedule.

### Text alignment for matches from TD view
status text such as "completed", "pending", "awaiting confirmation", and match options like "enter result", and "void" aren't visually aligned. in particular, the "void" option is clearly visually slightly lower inside the box than the other text. should fix this and recheck text alignment for other text fields as well.

## Version 0.3.1

### Game score validation
- Score gap when either score is >11 has to be at most 2. This is because the win by 2 rule has to take place after deuce (10-10) is reached. Need to reject game scores like 11-50.
